# List of Book / eBook Writing Resources

## Intro

There are tons of book / eBook writing resources, and in the process of writing mine I found myself adding more and more browser bookmarks and accumulating PDF files with high quality material. The purpose of this list is to be a one-stop resource to everything that's related to eBook writing.

When a resource is free, an icon will appear next to it.

### How To Contribute

We welcome contributions! It's [easy](https://github.com/oferze/book-and-ebook-writing-resources/wiki/Contribution). Please read [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- Read the [TODO](/TODO.md) file
- [Send a PR](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change)

Please note:

- We prefer **multiple small commits** rather than one large change in a pull request - it's fine to have one PR, but please make sure your title reflects what you're changing, thanks.
- Some products and services cost money. Some require registration or other forms of engagement. We don't want, and can't, enlist every book / eBook writing resource or tool on planet Earth. The editorial decision whether to include a resource or not is ultimately mine, as someone _has_ to govern _any_ open repository.
